			<h3>The Role of VR Moving Forward</h3>

				<p>Virtual Reality is one of the most mesmerizing technological advancements that has graced today’s world.
          A concept that was seen only in science fiction has become a trend among a lot of people in many different fields of work like the visual arts, computer sciences and cognitive sciences.
          Like how video games in general revolutionized the way in which we can showcase our creativity and vision on a screen in front of us, using virtual reality we can exhibit our inner ingenuity in a stimulated world all around us.
          Although it is still a relatively new medium, it has already proven that its potential is limitless, among them being the potential to truly become “the last medium”.

</p>
<p>

Virtual Reality applications have already been integrated into conventional media. There are many VR films, documentaries, video games and many more that have been already produced.
The feeling of immersion that people get from these productions is different from typical forms of visual entertainment. People can feel like they are the characters in these splendid productions.
Technologically and creatively speaking, it can without a doubt take us to the deepest of seas or to the farthest of galaxies from the comfort of our own homes. The “Reality” in VR implies that it is a means of escaping from everyday life at a moment’s notice.
After watching The Dark Knight as a stunned seventh grader, I wanted to figure out how I could become the Silent Guardian. Yet when I played Arkham Asylum, the Batman video game, I found myself mesmerized more by the architecture of Gotham, the design of her streets, and the atmosphere of the chase than the hero himself.
Now that the Batman VR game has come out, I can experience the majesty of Gotham city through the eyes of the Caped Crusader whilst still in my room. VR gives us the freedom of who and where we choose to be.

  At the moment, it does seem like just another device that rich kids own. Just a VR headset is expensive enough, it also requires a high-quality gaming console or a very powerful computer to operate.
  However, this should not be the reason to not develop VR to its boundless possibilities and capabilities.
  It can enrich the lives of disabled people like patients of paralysis by giving them the feel of being normal or even super human which they will be very cherished by them.
  It has the potential to help us develop visual aids that can serve as therapeutic remedies for the mentally unstable and children with autism or Asperger’s syndrome.
  It has the power to unlock their inner creativity whilst they experience an environment which they have control over, an environment which welcomes them for who they are.
  Researchers are even developing a stimulation that can be accessed by blind or deaf people.
  VR can become the universal medium for everyone to express themselves and to further research new discoveries precisely because of the myriad impacts it can have on so many people.(Taken from one of my English assignments)
