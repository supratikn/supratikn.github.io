			<h3>Why Software Engineering?</h3>
			<hr>
			<div class="col-md-8">
				<font size="+7">
				<p>When I watched The Dark Knight as a stunned seventh grader, I wanted to figure out how I could become the Silent Guardian. Yet when I played Arkham Asylum, the Batman video game, I found myself mesmerized more by the architecture of Gotham, the design of her streets, and the atmosphere of the chase than the hero himself. I have spent many weekends tearing apart my computer and putting it back together, searching the internet for hours to find what makes this fictional world and its interactive visual medium so life-like. I aim to one day be the hero who creates a world of his own, one which combines all the characteristics of my favorite stories and characters and inspires young boys and girls to allow their imaginations to roam freely. 
</p>
<p>

I’ve recognized my passion lies in the world of interactive software. My myriad interests, in truth, have all directed me towards software; interactive software combines nearly all of my interests. An appreciation for superheroes, science fiction, the arts, and narrative enrich the experience and allow the games to come to life and transcend the medium to explore larger questions people struggle to answer. I continue to be amazed by the creativity and imagination shown by software engineers and the limitless possibilities of coding. 
</p>

<p>
  I am drawn to computer science precisely because of the impact it can have on so many people. It has the potential to help us develop visual aids that can serve as therapeutic remedies for the mentally unstable and children with autism or Asperger’s syndrome. It has the power to unlock their inner creativity whilst they experience an environment which they have control over, an environment which welcomes them for who they are.

</p>
				<p>
					Almost as exciting as imagining the worlds I could build, is thinking about where I could build them. I have a number of aspirations: I want to work as an employee for a software company and devote myself to its latest innovations. I want to become a professor and research cutting edge A.I. algorithms to put into the playable characters. I want to become an entrepreneur and make my creations accessible to the broader public. I want to get experience to help me get one step closer to my goal of making a positive difference through code.
